This project aims at showing the evolution of homicide rates in Europe over 30 years.

Technically, inside a **quarto** document:

-   **R** is used to manipulate data.
-   **Javascript** (ObservableJS) is then used to produce reactive content.
-   *Plotly.js* and *Leaflet.js* are used to produce a chart and a map.
